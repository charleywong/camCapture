# camCapture

Program written for COMP6441 (UNSW)
by. Charley Wong.

## Steps to run
1. Download repository
2. Open terminal and change directory to location of repository
3. run ./capture

Images will be saved to the directory the program is in.

Two images will be produced, one darker than the other, the first image ever captured will always be dark. There is no way I can change this, but taking the image twice means that the second image will always be usable.
